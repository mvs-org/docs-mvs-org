# Download 
Please download the wallet installation package from Metaverse’s official website [https://mvs.org](https://mvs.org). The wallet is now support Windows 64bit system.

There are standard and data packet versions of the installation package. The packet version comes with a database, which greatly reduces the time required for initial block syncing. We recommend that new users download and install this version; existing users are recommended to install the standard version, because the packet version may overwrite some raw data. Please choose the appropriate installation package.

# Install
Double-click the installation file and follow the prompts to complete installation. After the installation is complete, the wallet shortcut icon shows up on the desktop. Double-click the wallet icon to open it and enter the login page.
